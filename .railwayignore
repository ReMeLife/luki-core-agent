# Railway Ignore File
# This file tells Railway what to exclude from deployment
# Unlike .gitignore, we want to INCLUDE the gitignored files for deployment

# Standard exclusions for Railway

# Keep all the git ignored files that are needed for deployment
# (by NOT listing them here, they will be included)
# EXPLICITLY ALLOW: _context/ and prompts/ must be included despite being gitignored
!_context/
